# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to unsupervised machine learning techniques in order to create a report on cryptocurrencies for an Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting - an investment bank. This report should detail which cryptocurrencies are currently trading in the market and how they should be grouped in order to create a cryptocurrency investment portfolio that the company can offer its customers.

Creating this report involved cleaning up and preprocessing data to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA), clustering data using the KMeans algorithm, and providing visualizations for our results.

All results, as well as the process used to arrive at these conclusions, can be seen in the [crypto_clustering.ipynb](https://github.com/josem279/Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/crypto_clustering.ipynb) file.
